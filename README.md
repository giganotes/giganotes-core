# Giganotes Core

Giganotes core is a native component for [GigaNotes](https://giganotes.com) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
The library is integrated to [GigaNotes Desktop](https://github.com/giganotes/giganotes-desktop) and [GigaNotes Mobile](https://github.com/giganotes/giganotes-mobile) applications.
Sharing native code between different platform sallows us to reach essential performance boost in computation-intensive tasks and code reuse.
